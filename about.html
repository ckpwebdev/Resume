        <p>
          I am a junior mobile and web developer with a Mobile &amp; Web Developer diploma from Sundance College.
          I enjoy turning real-world problems into clean, maintainable solutions and collaborating with teams to ship useful products.
        </p>
        <p>
          My background as a computer technician and my experience in digital marketing give me a strong mix of technical skills,
          troubleshooting ability, and an understanding of how software supports business goals.

      <div>
        <h2 class="about-subheading">How I Work</h2>
        <p>
          I care about building responsive, accessible interfaces, keeping code organized, and communicating clearly with clients and teammates.
          Reliability, testing, and small, frequent improvements are important parts of how I like to work.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m comfortable working independently or in a remote team, using modern tools like GitHub, Azure, and project management platforms
          to keep projects on track.
